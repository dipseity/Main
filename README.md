Increasingly, we are living double lives. There is our physical, everyday existence.Â  And there is our digital identity, the sum of all the digitally available information about us. As this information grows in volume and variety, the picture of us that it creates is becoming surprisingly complete. And valuable.

For organizations, the opportunities digital identity presents are enormous. Applications that leverage personal data can boost efficiency, help focus research and marketing efforts, and spur the creation of personalized products and services that, in turn, spur revenues. For consumers, the benefits are compelling, too: faster service, lower prices, and products better suited to their needs, to name a few.

But realizing the full potential of our digital identity is not a given. The picture of us that it provides is becoming not only fuller, but also more accurate and more traceable. People are worried about loss of privacy and the improper use of their personal information. Companies fear the backlash that could result if they approach digital identity in the wrong way. In an increasingly digital society, personal data have become a new form of currency. 

The challenge is to establish the trust that keeps this information flowing.
